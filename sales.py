- Collect information needed for a reservation as the employee converses naturally with a bot
- Ability to create a draft order into an employee's UR Max account

Technologies:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilize NLP techniques to process and understand unstructured text data from employee interactions
- Generative AI (Gen AI): Employ state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses and content based on employee inputs
- Cloud Computing: Leverage elastic compute systems to deploy the tool for users to access
